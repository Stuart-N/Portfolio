        <p>
          I’m passionate about web technologies - in particular, their intersection with education and languages. I love the challenge of using my technical and creative skills to build things of entrepreneurial, educational and social value.
          <br><br>
          <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_of_us_don_t_have_one_true_calling
" target=”_blank”>‘Multipotentialite’</a> (n.): an individual whose interests and abilities span multiple fields or areas, rather than being strong in just one.
          <br><br>
          I have a broad range of experiences, skills and interests to draw upon. From a young age, my dad instilled in me a technical and creative aptitude and a sharp eye for visual design and detail. My mom gifted me my passion for languages, lifelong education and EFL/ESL teaching. I’ve worked with a variety of people and organisations from around the world. I come from a vibrant and diverse country - South Africa - and have lived in Korea and China for close on six years, traveling extensively. Such varied experiences have proven me to be an adaptable and quick learner, not scared of new challenges, adept at problem solving. I excel at interacting empathetically with people from diverse backgrounds in multicultural environments. I’m a ninja organiser and professional communicator - with a fabulous sock collection.
          <br><br>
          I’m working to further develop my technical arsenal, focusing particularly on both front and back-end Javascript frameworks. In addition I’m also exploring aspects of NLP (natural language processing) in Python as well as UX (user experience) design. I enjoy hacking around with IoT (Internet of Things) technology (check out <a href="http://tokylabs.com/" target=”_blank”>TokyMaker</a>!). By far the highest priority, though, is getting my Chinese to the point where I'm able to direct impatient delivery drivers how to get my meal to me so I don’t starve.
          <br><br>
          In my spare time you might find me teaching myself a variety of musical instruments, practising Korean or Mandarin, drawn to anything that flies, or traveling to new hiking destinations. (Equally likely though: indulging in YouTube marathons whilst horizontal in my pyjamas. We can’t always be vertical. Life’s about 'balance', right?).
